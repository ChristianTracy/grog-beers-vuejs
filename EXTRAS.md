THINGS TO IMPROVE
- More granular components: create smaller vue components to improve the way we can combine them. 
- i18n: Manage texts in one place and add the possibility to change language. 
- Global state management: i worked with redux in some reactJS apps. It would like something good to add something similar here. Since i'm using only classic components the main behavior as fetching is managed in a bigger container component like HomeView. 
- Testing: vitest is already configured, unit tests should be added. 


STYLE
- Add bootstrap or similiar css framework.

DEVOPS
- Upload Docker to docker hub.
- Use env vars to manage all ports and API urls.
